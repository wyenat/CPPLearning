# CPPLearning

#### Reason of this project
Simple project to teach myself C++.
I already know C and Java so I'll start with another thing I've never done: I'll program a video game. (or something like this I don't know hihi)

I also know there is a lot of great material out there to teach myself, but as I have the time to do so, I'll take the long road and use as few ressources as I can.

## Configuration
##### IDE
I'll start with Visual Code. I'm used to use Eclipse or Netbeans, I want a bit less external help to start.
##### C++ Version
I find online that C++ 11 is pretty much is LTS version, and anything more recent will be hastle to use. So C++ 11 it is.

## Project
#### Idea
Still not entirely fixed on that. I want to do a game like Kadokado's Pioupiouz, on a round planet, that has its gravity growing up with the number of things on it.
So that's the following point to do :
- Have a GUI that renders real time texture
- Have a time ticker to simulate
- Have a physical engine
- Have a simple I/O system
- The actual game.
